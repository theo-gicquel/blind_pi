				<p>RACE</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
                <p>You've probably been told all your life "race doesn't exist." But every year, more and more evidence piles up proving the opposite. It turns out that each race has unique traits that make it special. After digesting these facts about race, you will start to see the human biodiversity around you. </p>

				<h1>different dogs know different tricks</h1>
				<p>Some dog breeds are bred for hunting, some for protection. Some are bred as companions, and some to be tiny and cute. Some dogs run races, and others herd sheep. </p><p>No dog can be said to be superior to all other dog breeds, but many breeds are superior at one or two things.</p><p>Pictured here is a "newfoundland" breed dog, a very large dog bred for strong swimming in low temperature water. It specialises in saving people from drowning if they fall off a fishing boat.</p>

				<h1>human races have different tricks too</h1>
				<p>Why are Kenyans overwhelmingly represented in gold medals for sprints? Why are most NFL football players african-american? Why are so many Nobel prize winners Jewish? Why are the Irish over-represented in banking? Why do whites build societies that everyone wants to live in?</p>
				<p>The answer is human biodiversity. Just like in RPGs, all races have both advantages and disadvantages compared to other races. </p>
